**Overview of the paper:** The research explores stress factors affecting students in higher educational institutions in Delhi-NCR, delving into demographic, academic, and socio-economic influences on perceived stress levels.

**Key Findings of the paper:** 
- Over 65% of students in the study reported moderate to high levels of stress, attributed to academic and socio-economic pressures.
- Key stressors identified include academic pressure (exams, curriculum demands, time constraints), financial concerns, and pressures from family, peers, and faculty.
- Studentsâ€™ stress levels varied by demographic factors such as family income, year of study, and type of academic program. Students with higher family income reported lower stress, while first-year students and those in professional courses experienced more stress.
- The paper suggests a holistic approach to managing student stress, including regular counseling, recreational activities, and collaborative support among parents, faculty, and peers.

**My Contributions towards the Paper:**
- Assisted in preparing a comprehensive literature review, covering various studies on academic stress and its impacts.
- Contributed to analyzing survey data from over 1,000 students and faculty at Delhi University.
- Discussed and suggested strategies for implementing stress management approaches tailored to the academic community, supporting student well-being.
